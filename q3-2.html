Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites or web applications. It involves a combination of coding, designing, and deploying to bring functionality and aesthetics to the internet. Web developers use programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the structure, style, and interactivity of websites. The development process includes front-end development for user interface and experience, as well as back-end development for server-side logic and database management. Web development also encompasses responsive design for optimal viewing across various devices, ensuring a seamless and accessible online experience for users.
